# dracut-modules-sdcard-replug 
This is a simple dracut module that may be used on Asus Chromebook CX1400CNA (well, it is suitable for all laptops/pcs with similar hrdware config/problems, but all addresses are hardcoded).  
Clone, run `make install` and rebuild your initramfs with dracut (module will be already added to your config).
